## Summary
This dataset is obtained from the RITA website which contains information about flight delays and performance. The dataset I used ranges from 2012-2017. The dataset can be found in the following website:
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp
I have created the visualizations in Tableau that answer the following questions:
1. What are the percentages of different types of flight delays or cancelled/diverted arrivals and how they are distributed over months, carrier types and airports?

2. What are the carriers that cause most delays when all the airports are taken into account and what are the airports that contribute for these delays the most for different carriers?
3. What are the airports that cause the most delays when all the carriers are taken into account and also what are the airports that cause most delays for a particular carrier?
4. What are the top 10 airports and carriers that are responsible for the delays and when combined together how do they affect each other?
